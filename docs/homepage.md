### a "boutique.py" overview

This is a demo of using Markdown documents with simple
JSON front matter to generate a static website with 
`boutique.py` using [py_sitetools](https://github.com/rsdoiel/py_sitetools)and [py_dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/py_dataset).

This file was create in "docs/homepage.md" but gets rendered to
[index.html](/) in the site directory folder.
