# This "three" sub folder landing page

It was rendered from the "docs/two/index.md" file. The
front matter included is in YAML.  It causes the output to
be rendered as [htdocs/three/index.html](/three/)
path of the site directory. In this way boutique.py is
supporting naming independent of where files are stored based
solely on the front matter directing the output.
